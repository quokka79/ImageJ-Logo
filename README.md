# ImageJ-Logo
Here is my submission for the [new ImageJ logo competition](http://forum.imagej.net/t/vote-for-the-new-imagej-logo/8895) as well as some accessory files detailing how it can be constructed from shape primitives. An SVG version of the logo is below:

## Accessory files:
* **IJ Logo - Using PowerPoint shapes.pptx** - A PowerPoint file showing how to build the logo using the built-in drawing shapes.
* **IJ Logo Construction.pdf** - A PDF showing a plan of the logo's construction. This PDF can be opened in Adobe Illustrator to access the logo shapes and layers too.
* **MakeLogoMacro.ijm** - An ImageJ macro to construct the logo from scratch using ROI selection shapes. The macro follows the same directions as described in the text file found here.
* **IJ Logo Instructions.txt** - Text instructions to build the logo, e.g. as a basis for scripted construction.

My original [submission post on the ImageJ Forum](http://forum.imagej.net/t/contest-new-imagej-logo/8485/22) has some more information and contextual images.
