# ImageJ-Logo
Here is my submission for the [new ImageJ logo competition](http://forum.imagej.net/t/vote-for-the-new-imagej-logo/8895) as well as some accessory files detailing how it can be constructed from shape primitives. An SVG version of the logo is below:

## Accessory files:
* **IJ Logo - Using PowerPoint shapes.pptx** - A PowerPoint file showing how to build the logo using the built-in drawing shapes. Also contains finished versions for easy copy-pasting.
* **IJ Logo Construction.pdf** - A PDF showing a plan of the logo's construction. This PDF can be opened in Adobe Illustrator to access the logo shapes and layers directly.
* **IJ Logo Instructions.txt** - Text instructions to build the logo, e.g. as a basis for scripted construction.
* **IJ_logo_quokka79.svg** - Logo in SVG format.
* **ImageJ Logo - quokka79.ai** - Logo in Adobe Illustrator format.
* **ImageJ Logo - quokka79.png** - Logo in PNG format, with transparent background.
* **MakeLogoMacro.ijm** - An ImageJ macro to construct the logo from scratch using ROI selection shapes. The macro follows the same directions as described in the text file in this repo.


My original [submission post on the ImageJ Forum](http://forum.imagej.net/t/contest-new-imagej-logo/8485/22) has some more information and contextual images.

### Colours
The slight difference in colours -- mainly in the blue -- between the forum post and the images here is due to the conversion from CMYK to RGB in the original image export; this conversion has left the blue looking a bit washed out. The colours shown here are the intended (RGB) colours. However, if you want to use the colours which match the original submission they are RGB(114,200,218) or #72C8DA for the blue and RGB(254,203,54) or #FECB36 for the yellow.
