Note 1: Draw all shapes centered about the origin. The specified translations will result in the logo also being centered about the origin.
Note 2: The optional shape in j02 is to help some types of drawing software (e.g. Adobe Illustrator) to create the correct intersection of shapes when performing step j09.

To draw the i:

i01. Draw a circle of diameter 1.00 unit (See Note 1; all shapes start out centered about the origin). Translate this shape 0.55 units left and 0.55 units down.
i02. Draw a rectangle 1.00 unit wide and 1.60 units high. Translate this shape 0.55 units left and 0.25 units up.
i03. Retain the intersection of the two shapes drawn in i01 and i02.
i04. Draw a circle of diameter 1.00 unit. Translate this shape 0.55 units left and 1.65 units up.
i05. Fill the shapes i03 and i04 with colour #0096FF (RGB 0, 150, 255) and no stroke.

To draw the j:

j01. Draw a rectangle 1.00 unit wide and 1.60 units high. Translate this shape 0.55 units to the right 0.25 units up.
j02. [Optional, see Note 2] Draw a circle of diameter 1.00 unit. Translate this shape 0.55 units to the right and 0.55 units down.
j03. Draw a circle of diameter 3.20 units. Translate this shape 0.55 units left and 0.55 units down.
j04. Draw a circle of diameter 1.20 units. Translate this shape 0.55 units left and 0.55 units down.
j05. Subtract the smaller circle (j04) from the larger circle (j03).
j06. Draw a square 1.60 units each side. Translate this shape 1.35 units to the right and 1.35 units down.
j07. Retain the intersection of the square from j06 and the donut shape from j05.
j08. Draw a circle of diameter 1.00 unit. Translate this shape 0.55 units to the left and 1.65 units down.
j09. Retain the intersection of shapes j01, j07, and j08 (and j02 if you drew it; See Note 2.)
j10. Draw a circle of diameter 1.00 unit. Translate this shape 0.55 units to the right and 1.65 units up.
j11. Fill the shapes j09 and j10 with colour #FFCC00 (RGB 255, 204, 0) and no stroke.
